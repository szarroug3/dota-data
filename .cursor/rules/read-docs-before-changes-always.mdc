description: Read Docs Before Changes Always
alwaysApply: true

- Before making any file changes, review all relevant documentation, including architecture, design, and implementation docs.
- If documentation is missing or unclear, request clarification or update the docs as needed.

<example>
Agent reads architecture/README.md before editing src/app/api/heroes/route.ts.
</example>
<example type="invalid">
Agent edits src/app/api/heroes/route.ts without reading any docs.
</example>
