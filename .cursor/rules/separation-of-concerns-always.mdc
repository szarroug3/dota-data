- Backend and frontend code must be kept in separate directories and files.
- Do not mix backend and frontend logic, imports, or dependencies in the same file or folder.
- Project structure should clearly distinguish backend and frontend areas (e.g., src/backend/ and src/frontend/ or similar).
- If a file or folder contains both backend and frontend code, refactor to separate them.

<example>
Agent places backend API handlers in src/app/api/ and frontend React components in src/components/.
</example>
<example type="invalid">
Agent puts both API route handlers and React components in the same file or folder.
</example>
