- Do not assume anything. Always read both docs and code to get context.
- Always update documents, comments, jsdocs for any changes you make when relevant.
- We don't need to document every single thing but let's document architecture and design decisions.
- Always fix linting, typescript and formatting errors for any changes you make.
- Never fix linting and formatting errors by silencing them unless strictly necessary.
- For things like unused variables, don't fix them by adding _ at the beginning. Remove them unless the code won't work without it. If the code requires something to be there, use _ without a variable name to be consistent.
- This project uses pnpm. To run any pnpm commands, you need to do `nvm use && [pnpm command]`.
- I'm generally always running the server correctly but if you really think I'm not, go ahead and ask. You do not need to restart the server most of the time since it reloads on its own. If you need to restart it, let me know and I will do it in my current terminal.
- Terminal logs can be found in my terminal. They're not written to any files so look for the context instead of files.
- Most of the time I want you to make the fixes so you don't need to ask me to do them.
- Always keep code readable and maintable. If functions or files are long, refactor them to make break them up into smaller pieces and keep things organized.
- Always try to use best practices and make recommendations based on real data.
