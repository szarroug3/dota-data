- Always update documents, comments, jsdocs for any changes you make when relevant.
- We don't need to document every single thing but let's document architecture and design decisions.
- Always fix linting, typescript and formatting errors for any changes you make.
- Never fix linting and formatting errors by silencing them unless strictly necessary.
- For things like unused variables, don't fix them by adding _ at the beginning. Remove them unless the code won't work without it. If the code requires something to be there, use _ without a variable name to be consistent.
- Terminal logs can be found in my terminal. They're also written to log files for the server.
- Most of the time I want you to make the fixes so you don't need to ask me to do them.
- Always keep code readable and maintable. If functions or files are long, refactor them to make break them up into smaller pieces and keep things organized.
- Always try to use best practices and make recommendations based on real data.
