- For every new or modified code file that should have unit tests, ensure there are corresponding unit tests.
- The agent should determine if a file requires unit testing based on its purpose and content (e.g., utility functions, business logic, or components typically require tests; configuration or type-only files may not).
- Place tests in the appropriate test directory or file.
- Tests should always be in a file that has directory structure that matches the file it's testing, under src/tests/.
- For example, if the agent is writing a test for src/components/team/team-overview-stats/TeamOverviewStats.tsx, the test should be src/tests/components/team/team-overview-stats/TeamOverviewStats.test.tsx.

<example>
Agent adds tests for a new function in src/lib/utils/format.ts and places the test in src/tests/lib/utils/format.test.ts. Agent does not add a test for a type-only file.
</example>
<example type="invalid">
Agent adds a new function in src/lib/utils/format.ts but does not add or update any tests, or places the test in an unrelated directory. Agent adds a test for a file that does not require testing (e.g., a type-only file).
</example>
