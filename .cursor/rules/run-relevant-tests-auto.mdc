description: Automatically run relevant tests after code changes.

- After making changes to code, run all relevant tests for affected files.
- If any tests fail and you make fixes, rerun all relevant tests to confirm all issues are resolved. Only consider the task complete when all tests pass.
- Tests should always be in a file that has directory structure that matches the file it's testing, under src/tests/.
- For example, if the agent is writing a test for src/components/team/team-overview-stats/TeamOverviewStats.tsx, the test should be src/tests/components/team/team-overview-stats/TeamOverviewStats.test.tsx.

<example>
Agent runs tests in src/tests/components/team/team-overview-stats/TeamOverviewStats.test.tsx after editing src/components/team/team-overview-stats/TeamOverviewStats.tsx. If a test fails and is fixed, agent reruns the tests to confirm all pass.
</example>
<example type="invalid">
Agent edits code but does not run the relevant tests, or the tests are not in the correct directory structure. Agent fixes a failing test but does not rerun the tests to confirm all pass.
</example>
