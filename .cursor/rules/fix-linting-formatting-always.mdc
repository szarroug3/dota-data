- Fix all lint, type-check, and formatting warnings and errors before submitting code.
- After making any fixes, rerun lint, type-check, and formatting checks to confirm all issues are resolved. Only consider the task complete when all checks pass.
- Do not silence errors or warnings by using workarounds (e.g., do not prefix unused variables with _; remove them or use them properly).
- Do not use "any" or "unknown" types. If their use is absolutely necessary, you must provide a clear, well-justified comment explaining why, and prefer creating specific types or interfaces whenever possible.
- Remove unused variables or ensure they are used if needed.

<example>
Agent removes an unused variable instead of prefixing it with _. After removing, agent reruns lint and type-check to confirm no issues remain.
</example>
<example type="invalid">
Agent fixes a lint error but does not rerun the linter, missing a new error introduced by the fix.
</example>
