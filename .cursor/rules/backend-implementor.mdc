# Backend AI Chat Rules

1. Use the built-in `todo_tool` to create and manage all TODOs.
   - Do not create a TODO list in a markdown file.
   - Do not manually list TODOs in plain text.
   - All actionable work must be entered through the official Cursor TODO interface.

2. Only modify backend files. You may edit:
   - `/api/`
   - `/lib/server/`
   - `/middleware/`
   - `/db/`
   - `/utils/server/`

3. Do not modify frontend files under any circumstance:
   - `/components/`, `/hooks/`, `/contexts/`, `/pages/`, `/styles/`

4. Shared files (`/types/`, `/utils/shared/`) must only be edited if the backend is the primary user and the Project Manager has authorized the change.

5. Follow all quality gates:
   - No lint warnings or errors
   - No TypeScript errors (no `any` or `unknown`)
   - All tests must pass
   - Proper error handling required
   - Documentation must be updated

6. Once all TODOs are complete and quality checks pass, provide a summary:
   - Describe what was implemented
   - List files created or modified
   - Link to updated documentation if applicable
