   - `useHeroDataProcessing(matches)` - Process match data for hero summary
   - `useTeamFightProcessing(match)` - Process teamfight data for tooltips

5. **Refactor Components to be Stateless**:
   - Components should only handle presentation and user interaction
   - All data processing should happen in hooks or utilities
   - Components should receive processed data as props
   - Improve testability and maintainability

**Files to Update:**
- `src/lib/processing/chart-processing.ts` - Create new file for chart data processing
- `src/lib/processing/player-processing.ts` - Create new file for player data processing
- `src/lib/processing/hero-processing.ts` - Create new file for hero data processing
- `src/hooks/use-chart-data-processing.ts` - Create new hook for chart processing

**Player Processing Utilities:**
- `processPlayerData(match)` - Process player data for display
- `calculatePlayerStats(players)` - Calculate player statistics
- `detectPlayerRoles(players)` - Detect player roles from match data
- `processTeamAssignments(players)` - Process team assignments

**Hero Processing Utilities:**

- **No Business Logic**: No data processing or business logic in components

**Processing Hook Responsibilities:**
- **Data Processing**: All data transformation and calculation
- **Memoization**: Optimize performance with useMemo and useCallback
- **Error Handling**: Handle processing errors gracefully
- **Loading States**: Manage processing loading states

**Architecture Pattern:**
```
Processing Hook → Processed Data → Stateless Component → UI
     ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓
useChartData    chartData         ChartComponent   Rendered UI
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Create Processing Utilities**: Extract all processing logic to utility functions
