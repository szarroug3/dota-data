## 📋 **Implementation Checklist**

### Phase 1: Data Flow Architecture Improvements (Priority 1) - ✅ COMPLETED

#### 1.1 Pass TeamData Objects Instead of Primitive IDs
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All contexts updated

**Completed Changes (TeamData):**
- ✅ Updated `addTeam(teamId, leagueId)` to accept primitives but pass TeamData internally
- ✅ Updated `refreshTeam(teamId, leagueId)` to accept primitives but pass TeamData internally  
- ✅ Updated `removeTeam(teamId, leagueId)` to accept primitives but pass TeamData internally
- ✅ Updated `editTeam(currentTeamId, currentLeagueId, newTeamId, newLeagueId)` to accept primitives but pass TeamData internally
- ✅ Removed unnecessary variable assignments and throw statements
- ✅ Implemented team-specific error handling instead of global errors
- ✅ Added graceful handling for missing teams in edit operations

**Completed Changes (Match Context):**
- ✅ Added `error?: string` to Match interface
- ✅ Updated `addMatch(matchId)` to accept primitives but pass Match objects internally
- ✅ Updated `refreshMatch(matchId)` to accept primitives but pass Match objects internally
- ✅ Updated `removeMatch(matchId)` to accept primitives but pass Match objects internally
- ✅ Removed global error state and throw statements
- ✅ Implemented match-specific error handling using `updateMatchError()`
- ✅ Add graceful error handling without throwing
- ✅ Add optimistic updates with `createInitialMatchData()`

**Completed Changes (Player Context):**
- ✅ Added `error?: string` to Player interface
- ✅ Updated `addPlayer(playerId)` to accept primitives but pass Player objects internally

- ✅ Removed global error state and throw statements
- ✅ Implemented player-specific error handling using `updatePlayerError()`

**Architecture Decision:**
- **Public API**: Functions accept primitive IDs for UI simplicity
- **Internal Flow**: Create/retrieve objects and pass them around internally
- **Error Handling**: Set errors on specific object `.error` fields instead of global state
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle edge cases gracefully without throwing
- **Consistent Pattern**: All contexts follow the same architecture

#### 1.2 Implement Early Persistence Strategy
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Data integrity ensured

**Completed Changes:**

**Add Team Flow:**
- ✅ Persist immediately when user adds team (with loading state)
- ✅ Update persistence after fetching team/league data
- ✅ Don't persist match/player data (too large for localStorage)

**Remove Team Flow:**
- ✅ Persist immediately when team is removed
- ✅ Abort ongoing operations for that team
- ✅ Clean up unused matches/players

**Edit Team Flow:**
- ✅ Persist immediately when team is edited
- ✅ Abort ongoing operations for the old team
- ✅ Start operations for the new team

**Refresh Team Flow:**
- ✅ Show loading state in UI (no persistence needed)
- ✅ Update persistence when refresh completes

**Implementation Details:**
- Modified `useProcessTeamData` to persist team immediately with loading state
- Modified `useRefreshTeamSummary` to show loading state in UI (no persistence needed)
- Modified `removeTeam` to persist removal immediately
- Modified `editTeamData` to persist changes immediately
- Added error handling for persistence failures (continues operation even if persistence fails)
- All operations now persist to localStorage before and after data fetching (except refresh loading state)

#### 1.3 Add Top-Level Error Fields
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Error handling improvements complete

**Completed Changes (TeamData):**
- ✅ Added `error?: string` to TeamData interface

- **Player-Specific Errors**: Each `Player` has its own `error` field ✅
- **No Global Errors**: Removed global error state in favor of object-level errors ✅
