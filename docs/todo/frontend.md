### âœ… Fix Team List Erasure Issue When Adding Teams with Errors

  - [x] Identify the root cause: teams were being removed from list when API calls failed
  - [x] Remove the problematic code that filtered out failed teams
  - [x] Let completeTeamDataUpdate handle error states properly
  - [x] Ensure teams with errors remain in the list with error state
  - [x] Verify that existing teams are not affected when adding new teams

**Summary:**
âœ… Task completed: Fixed team list erasure issue when adding teams with errors
ðŸ“‚ Modified files:
- `src/contexts/team-context.tsx` - Removed problematic code that was filtering out failed teams
ðŸ”§ Changes made:
- **Removed problematic filtering** - The `addTeam` function was removing teams from the list when API calls failed

ðŸŽ¯ Bug fix benefits:
- **No more list erasure** - Adding a team with an error no longer removes existing teams
- **Better error visibility** - Users can see which teams have errors and what the errors are
- **Improved user experience** - Users don't lose their existing teams when adding problematic ones
- **Consistent behavior** - Error states are handled consistently across all team operations
